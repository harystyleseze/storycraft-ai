Step 1: Supabase Project Setup

First, you'll need to:

1. Go to https://supabase.com and create an account
2. Create a new project:

   - Choose an organization
   - Enter project name: storycraft-ai
   - Create a secure database password
   - Select a region close to your users

3. Get your project credentials from Settings > API:

   - Project URL
   - anon public key
   - service_role key (keep this secret)

4. Configure Authentication in Authentication > Settings:

   - Enable email authentication
   - Set Site URL to http://localhost:3000 (and later your production URL)
   - Add additional redirect URLs if needed

Let me create the authentication setup:

## ‚è∫ Write(.env.local)

Thinking‚Ä¶

The user is pointing out two issues:

1. No dark/light mode toggle
2. Auth pages have blank backgrounds (not consistent with landing page styling)

And they want:

1. Dark/light mode icon on landing page for easy switching
2. Consistency across all pages
3. Fewer code changes, practical solution, no overengineering

Let me think about this:

1. For dark/light mode, I need to:

   - Add a theme context/provider
   - Add toggle button to the header/landing page
   - Make sure all pages respect the theme
   - Use Tailwind's dark mode classes

2. For background consistency:

   - The auth pages currently don't have the gradient background that the landing page has
   - I need to make them consistent with the main design

Let me first check the current auth pages to see what backgrounds they have, then implement a simple theme system.

Looking at the auth pages I read earlier:

- signin page: bg-gradient-to-br from-slate-50 to-purple-50/20
- signup page: probably similar
- signout page: bg-gradient-to-br from-slate-50 to-purple-50/20
- error page: bg-gradient-to-br from-slate-50 to-purple-50/20

So they do have backgrounds, but maybe the user is seeing them as blank? Let me check if there's an issue.

Actually, let me implement the dark/light mode first, and then ensure consistency. I'll:

1. Create a simple theme context
2. Add theme toggle to header
3. Update all pages to use theme-aware classes
4. Make sure backgrounds are consistent

Let me start by creating a theme context and provider.

‚è∫ I'll implement dark/light mode and fix the background consistency across all auth pages. Let me create a simple theme system and update the pages.

---

Let me first create the theme context. I'll keep it simple and practical:

1. Create a ThemeContext that provides dark/light mode state
2. Use localStorage to persist the theme preference
3. Apply the theme class to the document root
4. Create a simple toggle component

## I'll use Next.js 14 patterns and make it as simple as possible.

Perfect! I've successfully implemented dark/light mode and fixed the background consistency across all pages. Here's what's been completed:

‚úÖ Theme System:

- Created ThemeContext with localStorage persistence and system preference detection
- Added to app layout with proper provider wrapping

‚úÖ Theme Toggle:

- Added moon/sun icon toggle to header (both desktop and mobile)
- Shows current theme state and toggles smoothly

‚úÖ Consistent Backgrounds & Dark Mode:

- All pages now use consistent gradient backgrounds: from-slate-50 to-purple-50/20 (light) / dark:from-slate-900 dark:to-purple-950/20 (dark)
- Hero section: Updated background, text colors, demo section, and interactive elements
- Dashboard: Loading states, welcome text, cards, and activity sections
- Auth pages (signin/signup/signout/error): Form elements, error states, navigation, and success messages

The dark/light mode toggle is easily accessible in the header, user preferences are saved, and all pages maintain visual consistency while looking
great in both themes. The solution is minimal and practical without overengineering.
