## üß† Prompt Engineering Examples

### For Story Expansion:

```txt
Expand this idea into a 5-paragraph structured story with a title, an introduction, build-up, climax, and resolution:

"I want to tell a story about a dragon who doesn't want to fight anymore."
```

### For Image Prompts:

```txt
Create highly visual prompts from the following story parts. Each prompt should describe a key scene.

Story:
{
  "introduction": "A dragon lies alone atop a mountain, tired of fighting.",
  ...
}
```

---

## üîÅ Voice or Text Input ‚Äî Unified Logic

If the user speaks their idea:

1. Isolate voice ‚Üí `ElevenLabs Voice Isolator`
2. Transcribe idea ‚Üí `Fal Whisper`
3. Use transcribed text as input to story expansion ‚Üí continue as above

If the user types their idea:

* Directly feed into story expansion ‚Üí continue as above

---

## üîÆ Optional Features Later

* üé≠ **Voice cloning**: Tell your own story with your own voice
* üåê **Language options**: Multi-language narration
* üìñ **Storybook output**: PDF book, not just video
* üìö **Genre presets**: Kids, sci-fi, drama, horror, romance
* ‚ú® **Scene animation**: Animate generated images for more dynamic video

---

## üí• Final Result

With a single idea or sentence from the user, your platform gives back a complete, narrated, visually rich **story video** ‚Äî with no writing, no scripting, no editing required.

Got it ‚Äî you're building a **universal, story-first AI storytelling platform**. Here's a clear breakdown of **how this entire pipeline would work** in your platform, *step-by-step*, from microphone to final video:

---

## üß† High-Level Workflow Overview

```plaintext
üé§ Mic Input (any story) 
‚Üí üßπ Audio Clean-up (Voice Isolation) 
‚Üí ‚úçÔ∏è Transcription (Whisper/Wizper) 
‚Üí üß† Story Structuring (Narrative Breakdown) 
‚Üí üñºÔ∏è Scene Prompt Generation 
‚Üí üé® Image Generation (per scene) 
‚Üí üîä Voice Synthesis (narration) 
‚Üí üéûÔ∏è Video Composition (images + narration + SFX)
```

Your platform should take **any story** and run it through this end-to-end pipeline. Let‚Äôs walk through each part with **purpose, logic, tools, and structure**.

---

## üîÅ Step-by-Step Breakdown

### 1. üé§ **Voice Input** (Raw Storytelling)

**User Action**: The user speaks freely ‚Äî just telling a story naturally.

**Your Platform**:

* Accept mic input or uploaded audio.
* Save it in `.mp3` or `.wav`.

---

### 2. üßπ **Voice Isolation**

**Why**: Remove background noise, music, crowd noise ‚Äî isolate voice only.

**Tool**: `ElevenLabs Voice Isolator`

```ts
const audioStream = await elevenlabs.audioIsolation.convert({
  audio: audioBlob,
});
```

---

### 3. ‚úçÔ∏è **Speech-to-Text (Transcription)**

**Why**: Convert isolated voice to raw text.

**Tool**: `Fal Whisper` or `Wizper`

```ts
const result = await fal.subscribe("fal-ai/wizper", {
  input: { audio_url: CLEAN_AUDIO_URL },
});
const rawTranscript = result.output.transcription;
```

---

### 4. üß† **Narrative Structuring / Story Enhancement**

**Why**: Raw transcript is just free speech. You want a structured **storyline** with:

* **Title**
* **Introduction / Hook**
* **Build-up**
* **Climax**
* **Resolution / Ending**

> This is what makes the platform *universal* ‚Äî it adapts any input into a good story format.

**Tool**: LLM (GPT-4, Gemini Pro)

**Prompt** example:

```txt
You are a story editor.

Structure the following transcript into a full, coherent story.
Break it into parts: Title, Introduction, Hook, Build-Up, Climax, and Ending.

Transcript:
"""
[User's raw transcript here]
"""

Return a JSON:
{
  "title": "...",
  "introduction": "...",
  "hook": "...",
  "build_up": "...",
  "climax": "...",
  "ending": "..."
}
```

**Output**: Fully structured story parts in JSON.

---

### 5. üñºÔ∏è **Scene Prompt Generation**

**Why**: Each story segment (intro, climax, etc.) becomes a **scene**. You need visual descriptions to generate art.

**Prompt**:

```txt
Convert the story segments below into vivid, AI image prompts.

Use one prompt per scene, with rich visual language.

Story segments:
{
  "introduction": "A lonely boy stands at the edge of a dark forest.",
  ...
}

Output:
[
  "A lonely boy standing at the edge of a mysterious forest at dusk, trees looming.",
  "A glowing portal appears deep in the woods, surrounded by swirling mist.",
  ...
]
```

---

### 6. üé® **Image Generation**

**Tool**: `Gemini 2.5 Flash Image`

```ts
for (const prompt of imagePrompts) {
  const response = await ai.models.generateContent({
    model: "gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview",
    contents: prompt,
  });
  const buffer = Buffer.from(response.candidates[0].content.parts[0].inlineData.data, "base64");
  fs.writeFileSync(`scene-${i}.png`, buffer);
}
```

**Result**: 1 image per scene (or more with prompt variations).

---

### 7. üîä **Narration Generation (TTS)**

**Why**: Use the *refined* story text (not the raw transcript) as **voiceover**.

**Tool**: `ElevenLabs Text-to-Speech` or Instant Voice Clone

```ts
const audio = await elevenlabs.textToSpeech.convert({
  text: fullStoryText,
  voice: "NarratorVoiceId", // can be user‚Äôs clone or default narrator
});
```

---

### 8. üé∂ **Music and SFX (Optional)**

**Tool**: `ElevenLabs Music API + SFX API`

* Create background music:

```ts
const track = await elevenlabs.music.compose({ prompt: "Epic fantasy", musicLengthMs: 30000 });
```

* Add sound effects for scenes (optional).

---

### 9. üéûÔ∏è **Video Assembly**

**Tool**: FFmpeg, Fal Video API, or Remotion

Combine:

* Scene images (`scene-1.png`, etc.)
* Narration audio
* Optional music/SFX

**FFmpeg Example**:

```bash
ffmpeg -framerate 1 -i scene-%d.png -i narration.mp3 -c:v libx264 -r 30 -pix_fmt yuv420p final.mp4
```

**OR use Fal:**

```ts
const result = await fal.subscribe("fal-ai/minimax-video/image-to-video", {
  input: {
    image_url: SCENE_IMAGE_URL,
    prompt: scenePrompt,
  },
});
```

---

## üß† Platform Logic (API/Workflow)

### Input:

* Microphone recording OR audio upload

### Backend Flow:

1. Voice isolation (ElevenLabs)
2. Transcription (Fal)
3. Story restructuring (LLM)
4. Scene breakdown (LLM)
5. Image gen per scene (Gemini)
6. TTS narration (ElevenLabs)
7. Combine into video (FFmpeg or Fal video)

### Output:

* A complete **video** telling the user‚Äôs story
* Delivered in minutes

---

## üí° Why This Is Universal

* **Any kind of story**: horror, sci-fi, personal memory, kids‚Äô bedtime story.
* **Single input source**: user just talks.
* **Platform does the rest**: structuring, narration, visuals, video.
